# Venture Plan

### Before you continue
This fork was created from Foxlit's add-on called Venture Plan. He owns this add-on, we just want to maintain it with our best effort until he is absent from the game. We tried to contact him for permission but didn't find a way. This means we DO NOT HAVE permission to work on this and if he says we must delete it, we will delete it immediately and without a word.

### What is this?
Big thanks to Reddit user TekGoNos for figuring this out. Check out his post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/obv9vf/is_the_venture_plan_addon_broken_as_of_91/h45xfg1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
